# myZork
myZork is a short text adventure game made in C++.

## How to play
The objective of the game is to find the secret tresure on an ancient tomb and retrieve all its riches by solving some contextual puzzles
using the objects and tool at their disposal. 

To interact with the environment, the player should type the action they want to carry out using commands like Look, Open, Close, Grab,
Drop, Use,...

Fights are carried out using Rock-Paper-Scissors and, thus, the player should type their prefferred option until the end of the fight.
No fleeing allowed.

Other commands include 'help' to show a small text exposing the basic mechanics of the game and 'exit' to quit the game.

## Notes
### Positives
It has been quite some time since I last built a project in C++ from scratch and it has been a nice refreshing experience. 
Development-wise, it has been interesting building this game layer by layer and adding new functionalities to expand 
gameplay capabilities (adding new types of interactions) and include more flexible ways to communicate with the player. 

### What to improve
For starters, I got kind of anxious and uneasy at the beggining (again, it had been quite some time since I takled a challenge
in C++) and got right into the code without a clear development plan and, even though, I like to keep expanding the requirements
for my code as I get creative and think of new ideas, it clearly makes for a not optimal solution. Some preproduction time would
have been wise in terms of determining the needs I had for each class and comming up with cleaner ways to communicate among them.
